#Project Title: Book Tracker â€“ Launch Page

ðŸ“š Project Overview:
A fully planned, self-initiated book tracking web application designed to help users manage their reading list (TBR) , discover new books, and track their reading progress.

ðŸ§± Current Phase: Frontend UI Development

> Structured the web page using semantic HTML5 (header, sections, buttons, etc.)

> Designed the layout using CSS3, focusing on:

> Flexbox for responsive and adaptive layouts

> Transitions & hover effects for smooth user interaction

> Typography & spacing for clean visual hierarchy

> Aesthetic color palette and book-themed design

ðŸ§  Skills Applied So Far:

> HTML5 for structure

> CSS3 for styling

> Responsive layout planning

> UI/UX principles in practice

ðŸ§© Skills & Tech to be Integrated (Phase-wise):

> JavaScript â€“ Add interactivity (dynamic buttons, dark mode toggle, etc.)

> React.js â€“ Convert static UI into a dynamic, reusable component-based frontend

> Flask (Python) â€“ Backend server for user management and data storage

> SQLite / PostgreSQL â€“ Persistent storage for reading list and user info

> User Authentication â€“ Secure login, personalized dashboards

> API Integration â€“ Book search, cover images (via OpenLibrary or Google Books API)


ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements:

> Full-featured TBR & Finished List management system

> Dark mode + custom themes

> User book stats and progress analytics

> Dashboard with filters, reviews, and book recommendations


>> Designed to evolve with my learning â€” each phase of development reflects a new skill mastered. It demonstrates clear understanding of full-stack architecture.
It is a meaningful, real-world project I can continuously improve. Showcases my commitment to hands-on learning, problem-solving, and clean development practices.
